# Tiny Scripts

Tiny Scripts was a collection of scripts I created and maintained for over a decade. I have since changed that practive to publishing them to individual homes, so search my other repositories instead.

Not all scripts were given a new home. These are no longer maintained but should nevertheless continue working indefinitely, so do use them for as long as you wish.
